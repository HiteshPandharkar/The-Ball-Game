# The-Ball-Game
## This is a brain teaser I found on the internet.
### You are given nine balls and an old fashioned weight balance. Out of the nine one ball is heavier than all the others. Given three weighings are needed to find the heavier ball, find the average number of weighings needed to find the ball in long run.
### The inspiration of the problem has been taken from the famous proposition that the average number of tries needed to find a given card from a set of four cards is 2.5.
